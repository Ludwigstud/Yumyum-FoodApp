Project Summary: YUM YUM EXAMINATION

The "YUM YUM EXAMINATION" project is a fully functional web application for food ordering, developed as a final examination assignment aiming for a high grade (VG). The application provides a complete user experience, from browsing the menu to receiving a final receipt.

Key Features:

Menu Display: Fetches and displays the restaurant's menu from an external API.

Cart Management: Users can add products to a digital shopping cart and remove them as needed.

Order Placement: Customers can submit their order and receive a unique order number along with an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).

Receipt Viewing: A key feature is the ability for users to view a detailed receipt of their purchase.

Technical Implementation:

The application is built using a modern tech stack to ensure a robust and efficient solution. It utilizes React for the user interface, with React Router managing navigation between views. State management is handled centrally by a Redux store implemented with Redux Toolkit. Asynchronous API calls are managed using createAsyncThunk. The application's design strictly follows a provided Figma sketch to meet all visual requirements.
